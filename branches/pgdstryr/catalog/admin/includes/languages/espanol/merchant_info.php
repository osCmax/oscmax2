            <table class=main cellspacing=\'0\' cellpadding=\'0\'>
              <tr>
                <td>Q: <strong>What cards will I be able to accept through my Merchant account?</strong> <br>
      A: All CDGcommerce merchants can process Visa and MasterCard transactions. In addition, by default - we apply for American Express, Discover and Diner\'s accounts electronically for you. This gives you the power to accept all five (5) major card types from our single merchant application. However, you are not required to accept any card type other than Visa/MasterCard if you do not wish. You can also setup to accept JCB, Debit/ATM Cards, EBT and e-Check processing as an option.
        <p>Q: <strong>What name will appear on my cardholder statements? </strong><br>
        A: Your Business DBA Name and DBA Phone #, as you specify on your merchant account application, will appear on your cardholder statements. Since this is a true merchant account, there is NO reference any other third party but instead this is 100% branded to your business. </p>
        <p>Q:<strong> I offer more than one product or service, is this ok? </strong><br>
        A: Yes, simply list the full scope of your products and services on your merchant account application. If the products &amp; services vary too greatly in nature or if you require multiple DBA names for your different products and services, it is recommended that you setup multiple merchant accounts to support this. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>I have multiple Web sites, is this ok?</strong> <br>
        A: Yes, this does not present any problem. You are not limited to having a single Web site and you can promote your specified products and services through as many sites as you wish. </p>
        <p>Q:<strong> Can I keep purchasers on my Web site without having to leave?</strong> <br>
        A: Yes, this can be readily accomplished through any of our payment gateway options. You are not required to have your customers place their orders through a specific area on our servers but you can process this data while they remain entirely on your Web site. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>I only have a personal checking account - is this acceptable?</strong> <br>
        A: Yes, this is acceptable for all sole proprietorships. If you are a <br>
        partnership or corporation, we generally require a business checking account. </p>
        <p>Q:<strong> Is there any kind of holdback or rolling reserve that applies?</strong> <br>
        A: By default, there is no risk reserve of any kind required for a typical merchant to be approved. Only on very high risk accounts do we require a reserve and this must be accepted in writing prior to approval of the account. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>How long does the approval &amp; activation process take?</strong> <br>
        A: For the vast majority of our applicants (95%), the entire process takes only 1-2 business days. If you submit a completed merchant application to us via fax before noon during a standard business day, your account is generally approved the same or next business day. For higher volume or more complex accounts, the above process can take longer due to the higher level of scrutiny required to approve the account. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>How are chargebacks and risk issues handled?</strong> <br>
        A: Chargebacks are handled within the standard VISA/MC guidelines. However, we do take the extra step to pro-actively assist you with your chargeback rebuttals to help you respond promptly to any chargebacks. Most importantly, we monitor all accounts pro-actively and watch all risk issues carefully. In the event that there is an issue or concern, we work closely with you and your business to resolve it quickly. Our efforts in this area result in a common-sense approach to risk management that is often very different from our competitors. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>My business is based outside of the U.S., can I still apply for an account?</strong> <br>
        A: Only if you fit the Merchant Approval Requirements as listed on our Web site. You must have a U.S. entity, mailing address and signer with a U.S. SSN. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>How quickly do I receive my funds and where are they deposited?</strong> <br>
        A: Upon receipt of your settled credit card sales batch, there is a funding time of 48 - 72 hours for you to receive your funds. All funds are deposited directly into your local bank account as specified on your merchant application. </p>
        <p>Q: <strong>Do I have to fax or can I e-mail a scanned copy of my application?</strong> <br>
        A: You may e-mail newaccounts@cdgcommerce.com with a scanned copy of your application or a PDF-saved file version. Or you may fax us at (310) 388-1224 with your application, whichever is most convenient for you. </p></td>
