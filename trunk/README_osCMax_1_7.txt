AABox.com osCMax V1.7 (September 2004) 
========================== 
The osCMax build of osCommerce is a combination of many of the most popular 
mods/contributions and osCommerce 2.2 MS2. The credit for the actual mods goes 
solely to the original authors of those mods and the many people who update 
them. Some of the mods have been modified to work with the new Basic 
Template Structure by me. I have simply put it all together in a nice package 
making it easier for users to get started without having to do any major 
hacking.

If you find any bugs or problems, please visit OSCdox.com and post your 
finidings in the forums there.

If there are other mods you would like to see incorporated, please visit 
OSCdox.com and post your request in the forums.
