osCommerce 2.2 Milestone 1 To-Do Notes
Copyright (c) osCommerce 2003

The following are known problems to exist in the Milestone 1 release.

1. File Uploading

Empty file uploads in the Administration Tool may update the entry filename to
contain the word "array".

2. Filename Lengths

Some filename lengths exceed the limit of 31 characters which poses a problem
for Mac OS 9.

3. No E-Mail Address Checking

There is no e-mail address checking in the Administration Tool -> Customers
area which might lead to duplicate e-mail addresses existing in the database
when records are updated.
