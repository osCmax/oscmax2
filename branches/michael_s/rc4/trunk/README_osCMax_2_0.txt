osCMax v2.0 (May 2005)
==========================
osCMax v2.0 e-commerce software is a combination of many of the most popular
mods/contributions and osCommerce 2.2 MS2. The credit for the actual mods goes
solely to the original authors of those mods and the many people who update
them. The goal of osCMax is to produce a more complete e-commerce package with
many more features than standard osCommerce.

If you have problems logging in or the login screen simply refreshes when you enter
the above credentials, it is NOT a bug with the software, you simply have not
installed the software correctly. There are about 200 posts at osCDox.com that deal
with this issue, please do a search and read before posting.

osCMax v2.0 is a major update to the v1.7 release. There are an immense number of
upgrades, updates, patches, fixes, and new mods included. While we have taken great
pains to test the features, there is no way we can test every possible configuration.

As in any complex and powerful software package, there will most likely be bugs or
problems with certain configurations. We have set up a bug reporting and tracking
center, as well as discussion forums for the purpose of tracking and fixing any bugs.
